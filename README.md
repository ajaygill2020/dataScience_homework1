# homework1 project

This homework assignment explores some models for sample data in the "data" folder. 

Development workflows
=======================

Create new project
----------------------

You've already done this if you are reading this file. You ran:

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ajaygill2020/cookiecutter-datascience-simple
```

Put project under version control
---------------------------------

Let's get version control set up. You don't absolutely have to do this, but you should. For the local repository, do;

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

For the remote repository, make a github repository named homework1, then do;

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:ajaygill2020/homework1.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Great. Using version control is good.

Here's the folder structure that gets created by `cookiecutter-datascience-simple`:

Documentation
--------------

I created some models for my first homework assignment. Please refer to the main notebook which is titled "gill_homework_one" since this has all of my work. You will find the data in the "data" folder.
